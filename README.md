Hanna is a defi agent. Designed for the general public and content creators.

Basic integration of a defi agent with image generation functions, bluesky account automation, simple interface.

You need an api key from Open AI and Netmind for image models.
You also need to create an auto api with dexterity-sdk for the defi function to work.
This model has a basic interface, we are working on a better one for version v2, in addition to image to video.
